Welcome!
========

FrontCompiler is a simple collection of compactors for the JavaScript,
CSS and HTML source code. It removes trailing whitespaces, comments and
transformates the local variables to make the sourcecode shorter.

The library can be used as a plugin for rails.

NOTE: the project is still in development, not everything works yet.


Usage
=====

It's pretty simple

@c = FrontCompiler.new

@compact_js = @c.compact_js(File.open('src/something.js', 'r'));
@compact_css = @c.compact_css(File.open('src/something.css', 'r'));
@compact_html = @c.compact_html(File.open('src/something.css', 'r'));

or shorter

@compact_js = @c.compact_file('src/something.js');
@compact_css = @c.compact_file('src/something.css');
@compact_html = @c.compact_file('src/something.css');

or you can compact several files at once like that

@library_code = @c.compact_files(%w{
  src/lib.js
  src/lib/something.js
  src/lib/another.js
})

Same for the other file-types
