Welcome!
========

FrontCompiler is a simple collection of compactors for the JavaScript,
CSS and HTML source code. It removes trailing whitespaces, comments and
transformates the local variables to make the sourcecode shorter.

The library can be used as a plugin for rails.


Usage
=====

It's pretty simple

@c = FrontCompiler.new

@compact_js = @c.compact_js(File.open('src/something.js', 'r'));
@compact_css = @c.compact_css(File.open('src/something.css', 'r'));
@compact_html = @c.compact_html(File.open('src/something.css', 'r'));

or shorter

@compact_js = @c.compact_file('src/something.js');
@compact_css = @c.compact_file('src/something.css');
@compact_html = @c.compact_file('src/something.css');

or you can compact several files at once like that

@library_code = @c.compact_files(%w{
  src/lib.js
  src/lib/something.js
  src/lib/another.js
})

Same for the other file-types


CSS Inlining
============

With the tool you can convert your css source in some javascript
definition so you could put the styles in the same file as your
javascript and have -1 (or several) hits to your sever.

File('public/javascripts/all_in_one.js', 'w') do |file|
  file.write @c.compact_files(%w{
    public/javascripts/prototype.js
    public/javascripts/effects.js
    public/javascripts/application.js
  })

  file.write @c.inline(
    File.open('public/stylesheets/application.css').read
  )
end

Now you have a single javascript file which contains both, javascript
and the application stylesheets in one.

Enjoy!
